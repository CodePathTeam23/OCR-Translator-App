// TODO: Evaluate app across the following categories using the App Evaluation Protocol.
**Category**: Travel, Entertainment
- Mobile: camera, real-time translator.
- Story: It's space-cunsuming for the manufacturers/ authorities to put instructions in more than one language in public facilities, so travellers/ users will find this app really useful when they want to use facilities that don't provide instructions in their language.
- Market: This app is for anyone who wants to travel to a different country speaking/ writing in a language they are not familiar with, also have you ever been to an ethnic supermarket and found products not in your native language and the attempt of the manufacturer to translate it is not helpful, well this app got you covered.
- Habit: Users will use it ocasionally when travelling or buying a product from a foreign country. The more it is used, the more accurate OCR and translator will become.
- Scope: Translaters have been and will be always needed in global communication.
